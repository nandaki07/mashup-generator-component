# Portfolio Part 1: Component Brainstorming

- **Name**: Nandaki Bhonagiri
- **Dot Number**: bhonagiri.4
- **Due Date**: 02/04 @ 3:00 PM

## Assignment Overview


The overall goal of the portfolio project is to have you design and implement
your own OSU component. There are no limits to what you choose to design and
implement, but your component must fit within the constraints of our software
sequence discipline. In other words, the component must extend from Standard and
must include both a kernel and a secondary interface.

Because this is a daunting project, we will be providing you with a series of
activities to aid in your design decisions. For example, the point of this
assignment is to help you brainstorm a few possible components and get some
feedback. For each of these components, you will need to specify the high-level
design in terms of the software sequence discipline. In other words, you will
describe a component, select a few kernel methods for your component, and select
a few secondary methods to layer on top of your kernel methods.

You are not required to specify contracts at this time. However, you are welcome
to be as detailed as you'd like. More detail means you will be able to get more
detailed feedback, which may help you decide which component to ultimately
implement.

## Assignment Checklist


To be sure you have completed everything on this assignment, we have littered
this document with TODO comments. You can browse all of them in VSCode by
opening the TODOs window from the sidebar. The icon looks like a tree and will
likely have a large number next to it indicating the number of TODOS. You'll
chip away at that number over the course of the semester. However, if you'd
like to remove this number, you can disable it by removing the following
line from the `settings.json` file:

```json
"todo-tree.general.showActivityBarBadge": true,
```

Which is not to be confused with the following setting that adds the counts
to the tree diagram (you may remove this one as well):

```json
"todo-tree.tree.showCountsInTree": true,
```

## Assignment Learning Objectives


Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Integrate their areas of interest in their personal lives and/or careers with
   their knowledge of software design
2. Determine the achievablility of a software design given time constraints
3. Design high-level software components following the software sequence
   discipline

## Assignment Rubric: 10 Points


Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

Below is further rationale/explanation for the rubric items above:

1. Each design must align with your personal values and long-term
   goals. Because the goal of this project is to help your build out a
   portfolio, you really ought to care about what you're designing. We'll give
   you a chance to share your personal values, interests, and long-term goals
   below.
2. Each design must be achievable over the course of a single
   semester. Don't be afraid to design something very small. There is no shame
   in keeping it simple.
3. Each design must fit within the software sequence discipline. In
   other words, your design should expect to inherit from Standard, and it
   should contain both kernel and secondary methods. Also, null and aliasing
   must be avoided, when possible. The methods themselves must also be in
   justifiable locations, such as kernel or secondary.

I hope to optimize existing solutions and create new solutions to problems that were never addressed. I aim to focus in areas of specialization such as cybersecurity which is such an important part of using technology. Optimizing and increasing the amount of security that any user has while using any piece of technology is highly important. I want to be involved in the implentation of this and contribute back to the community by developing in this area of technology. Lastly, I want to work my way up to a positon where I can be a mentor and a leader. I want to inspire others with my work and ideas at work. I want to work hard and be a role model to others while leading a team of individuals.

## Assignment


As previously stated, you are tasked with brainstorming 3 possible components.
To aid you in this process, we have provided [some example components][example-components]
that may help you in your brainstorming. All of these components were made at
some point by one of your peers, so you should feel confident that you can
accomplish any of them.

There is no requirement that you use any of the components listed above.
If you want to model something else, go for it! Very common early object
projects usually attempt to model real-world systems like banks, cars,
etc. Make of this whatever seems interesting to you, and keep in mind that
you're just brainstorming right now. You do not have to commit to anything.

### Example Component

To help you brainstorm a few components, we've provided an example below of a
component you already know well: NaturalNumber. We highly recommend that you
mirror the formatting as close as possible in your designs. By following this
format, we can be more confident that your designs will be possible.

- Example Component: `NaturalNumber`
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose of this component is to model a non-negative
      integer. Our intent with this design was to keep a simple kernel that
      provides the minimum functionality needed to represent a natural number.
      Then, we provide more complex mathematical operations in the secondary
      interface.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void multiplyBy10(int k)`: multiplies `this` by 10 and adds `k`
    - `int divideBy10()`: divides `this` by 10 and reports the remainder
    - `boolean isZero()`: reports whether `this` is zero
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void add(NaturalNumber n)`: adds `n` to `this`
    - `void subtract(NaturalNumber n)`: subtracts `n` from `this`
    - `void multiply(NaturalNumber n)`: multiplies `this` by `n`
    - `NaturalNumber divide(NaturalNumber n)`: divides `this` by `n`, returning
      the remainder
    - ...
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, basically all OSU components have to be mutable as long as they
        inherit from Standard. `clear`, `newInstance`, and `transferFrom` all
        mutate `this`.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - No. All methods work with integers or other NaturalNumbers.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Yes. NaturalNumber is base 10, and we track that in a constant called
          `RADIX`.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. The kernel methods `multiplyBy10` and `divideBy10` can be used to
        manipulate our natural number as needed. For example, to implement
        `increment`, we can trim the last digit off with `divideBy10`, add 1 to
        it, verify that the digit hasn't overflown, and multiply the digit back.
        If the digit overflows, we reset it to zero and recursively call
        `increment`.

Keep in mind that the general idea when putting together these layered designs
is to put the minimal implementation in the kernel. In this case, the kernel is
only responsible for manipulating a digit at a time in the number. The secondary
methods use these manipulations to perform more complex operations like
adding two numbers together.

Also, keep in mind that we don't know the underlying implementation. It would be
completely reasonable to create a `NaturalNumber1L` class which layers the
kernel on top of the existing `BigInteger` class in Java. It would also be
reasonable to implement `NaturalNumber2` on top of `String` as seen in
Project 2. Do not worry about your implementations at this time.

On top of everything above, there is no expectation that you have a perfect
design. Part of the goal of this project is to have you actually use your
component once it's implemented to do something interesting. At which point, you
will likely refine your design to make your implementation easier to use.

### Component Designs

> Please use this section to share your designs.

- Component Design #1: `ProjectTracker`
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose is to provide a project tracker that helps businesses track and plan their projects.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void addMilestone(String milestoneName, String description, String deadline)`: adds to project tracker a milestone with a name, description, and deadline
    - `void removeMilestone(String milestoneName)`: removes from project tracker a milestone that was previously added
    - `void updateMilestone(String milestoneName, String status)`: updates the status of a milestone (i.e. "In progress", "Not started", "Completed")
    - `String getMilestoneInfo(String milestoneName)`: returns the information about a specific milestone
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void calculateProgress()`: calculates the overall progress of a project based on the completed milestones
    - `void sendReminders()`: sends reminders for approaching milestones
    `void generateProgressReport(String fileName)`: generates a progress report and exports it as a PDF
    - `void sortMilestones()`: sorts milestones by their approaching deadlines
    - `void assignMilestone(String milestoneName, String owner)`: assigns a team member to a specific milestone and makes them the owner
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, the componenet would inherit from the Standard class.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - Yes, maybe to keep track of a specific milestone (for example, the name of the milestone, description, deadline, owner, etc.).
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Maybe, to keep track of the max number of milestones that can be added to a project, it could be stored in a constant.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes, for example, the calculateProgress method could utilize the getMilestoneInfo method to check the status of each milestone in the project and then calculate the percentage of completed milestones.

- Component Design #2: `BudgetPlanner`
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose of this component is to model a budget planner that helps individuals or businesses plan, track, and manage their finances.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void addIncome(String source, double amount)`: adds an income source (e.g., salary, freelance work) with a specified amount
    - `void addExpense(String category, double amount)`: adds an expense to a specific category (e.g., groceries, rent) with a specified amount
    - `void removeIncome(String source)`: removes an income source from the budget
    - `void removeExpense(String category)`: removes an expense category from the budget
    - `double getBalance()`: Returns the current balance (total income minus total expenses)
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void categorizeExpense(String category, String subcategory)`: adds a subcategory to an expense category
    - `void setFinancialGoal(String goalName, double targetAmount)`: sets a financial goal
    - `void trackGoalProgress(String goalName)`: tracks progress towards a financial goal based on the current balance
    - `void generateSpendingReport(String fileName)`: generates a spending report and exports it in a PDF format
    - `void adjustBudget(String category, double newAmount)`: adjusts the budget for a specific category
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, the component would be mutable because it inherits from Standard.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - Yes, maybe it would use internal classes like IncomeSource to store details about income and ExpenseCategory to store details about expenses.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, it might use enums like ExpenseType for categorizing expenses and constants like MAX_CATEGORIES to limit the number of expense categories.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes, for example, the trackGoalProgress method could use getBalance to compare the current balance with the target amount of a financial goal.

- Component Design #3: `InventoryTracker`
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose of this component is to keep track of the inventory of different products and materials for a warehouse or retail store.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void addProduct(String productName, String category, int quantity, double price)`: adds a product to the inventory with a name, category, quantity, and price
    - `void removeProduct(String productName)`: removes a product from the inventory
    - `void updateProductQuantity(String productName, int newQuantity)`: updates the quantity of the specified product
    - `void updateProductPrice(String productName, double newPrice)`: updates the price of the specified product
    - `double getProductPrice(String productName)`: returns the price of the specified product
    - `int getProductQuantity(String productName)`: returns the current quantity of the specified product
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void categorizeProduct(String productName, String newCategory)`: moves a product to a new category
    - `void setLowStockThreshold(String productName, int threshold)`: sets a low-stock threshold for a product and triggers an alert if the quantity falls below this threshold
    - `void generateSalesReport(String fileName)`: generates a sales report and exports it in a PDF format
    - `void restockProduct(String productName, int quantity)`: restocks a product by adding a specified quantity
    - `void applyDiscount(String productName, double discountPercentage)`: applies a discount to a product's price
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes because the componenet would inherit methods from `Standard` such as add, remove, and update.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - Yes it could use internal classes such as product to store the name and details of a specific product.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - I don't think so.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. For example, the setLowStockThreshold method could use getProductQuantity to check the current quantity of a product and trigger an alert if it falls below the threshold.

## Post-Assignment

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Changelog


At the end of every assignment, you should update the
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) file found in the root of the project folder.
Since this is likely the first time you've done this, we would recommend
browsing the existing file. It includes all of the changes made to the portfolio
project template. When you're ready, you should delete this file and start your
own. Here's what I would expect to see at the minimum:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) of
the following form: YYYY.0M.0D.

## 2025.02.04

### Added

- Designed a ProjectTracker component
- Designed a BudgetPlanner component
- Designed a InventoryTracker component
```

Here `2025.02.25` would be the date of your submission, such as 2024.04.21.

You may notice that things are nicely linked in the root CHANGELOG. If you'd
like to accomplish that, you will need to make GitHub releases after each pull
request merge (or at least tag your commits). This is not required.

In the future, the CHANGELOG will be used to document changes in your
designs, so we can gauge your progress. Please keep it updated at each stage
of development.

### Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that
you convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this [Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting. For future assignments, you will
just be submitting a link to a pull request. This will be the only time
you have to submit any PDFs.


### Peer Review


Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component brainstorming assignments for review. Your job during the
peer review process is to help your peers flesh out their designs. Specifically,
you should be helping them determine which of their designs would be most
practical to complete this semester. When reviewing your peers' assignments,
please treat them with respect. Note also that we can see your comments, which
could help your case if you're looking to become a grader. Ultimately, we
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).
